        <p className="text-brown mb-4 ">
          At WildXR, we believe that XR has the power to transform the way we interact with the world around us. By combining cutting-edge hardware and software, we're able to create experiences that are both engaging and transformative. Our virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) tours allow people to experience wildlife and nature in a realistic and immersive way, even if they are unable to travel to the actual wild due to financial or health constraints.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white">
          Our mission is to create more awareness about wildlife conservation and nature preservation in Rwanda and beyond. We believe that by using XR technology, we can break down barriers and bring the beauty of nature to people who cannot access it. We are committed to making a positive impact on the environment and promoting sustainable practices.
